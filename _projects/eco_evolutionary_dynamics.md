blurb: Evolution is governed by ecological interactions, but ecological dynamics are also shaped by evolution. Untangling the interactions between ecology and evolution is critical for understanding fundamental aspects of living systems. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental evolution, our lab studies how ecological processes (e.g., competition, infection, migration, cross-feeding) influence evolution (e.g., selection for novel genotypes, stable interdependency, maintenance of costly behaviors) and vice versa. We have explored the impact of restricted migration on life-history evolution and virulence in a bacteriophage (Kerr et al., 2006; Eshelman et al., 2010), the interplay between the level of monopolization of costly cellular products and the nature of production costs in driving microbial dependencies (Estrela et al. 2016), and how competitive interactions between bacteria that produce bacteriocins can lead to stable polymorphism of genotypes in spatially structured habitats (Majeed et al., 2011). We showed that as dispersal and ecological interaction becomes spatially restricted, various costly behaviors can be maintained (van Raay & Kerr, 2016), mutation-selection balance can shift (Cooper et al., 2015), and adaptive valleys can be traversed in the presence of sexual recombination (Cooper et al. 2016).
