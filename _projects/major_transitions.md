blurb: Life is hierarchically organized (with genes nested within cells nested within multicellular organisms nested within societies). This hierarchy itself is a derived state; all higher levels evolved from lower levels. We study how new levels of the biological hierarchy evolve and how these evolutionary transitions are stabilized once a new level is formed. Using the evolution of multicellularity as an example, we hypothesized that conflicts among the levels of selection could serve as fuel for the evolution of individuality (Rainey and Kerr, 2010). We also explored the conditions that favor the evolution of division of labor between cells within a multicellular organism (Goldsby et al, 2012; Goldsby et al, 2014; Libby et al, 2014). We find that mutations that increase the fitness of nascent multicellular organisms may have deleterious effects outside of the group context, leading to increased interdependence and the loss of cellular autonomy (Hammerschmidt et al, 2014; Libby et al, 2016). We are also exploring how host-symbiont interdependencies could lead to transitions in individuality in mutualistic symbioses (Estrela et al, 2016).
