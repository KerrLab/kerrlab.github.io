blurb: The environment plays a large role in determining which organisms within populations interact. In well-mixed environments, which are similar to shaken test tubes commonly used in lab experiments, each individual is equally likely to interact with any other individual. Here, competition is intense, and evolution tends to favor individuals that utilize common resources more quickly. On the other hand, when the environment is structured, and individuals only interact with their immediate neighbors, evolution can favor other strategies. We have found that these local interactions can promote behaviors like cooperation (Hammarlund et al. 2016; Connelly et al. 2016) and spite (Kerr et al. 2002), and can even favor more prudent use of resources (Kerr et al. 2006; Prado & Kerr 2008; Eshelman et al. 2010; Nahum et al. 2011). Structured habitats can also allow populations to reap the benefits of sexual recombination while avoiding its destructive potential (Cooper & Kerr, 2016). We are currently conducting large-scale, spatially structured experiments with bacteria in the lab using media-in-oil emulsions.
