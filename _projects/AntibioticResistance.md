blurb: The rise of antibiotic resistance is a current global health crisis. However, bacterial adaptation to antibiotics is also an extremely useful framework for studying the process of evolution. In our work examining the effects of rates of change in drug concentration on bacterial populations (Lindsey et al., 2013), we found that some evolutionary trajectories are contingent on slower rates of drug increase.  We have also used the lens of evolutionary game theory to better understand some forms of antibiotic resistance (Conlin et al. 2014). We are currently exploring the role of pleiotropy, epistasis, and plasmid evolution on the emergence of multi-drug resistance, and are using high-throughput genetic screening techniques to make short-term predictions about the evolution of resistance.
