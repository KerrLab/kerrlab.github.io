blurb: Organisms live in a dynamic world, where various environmental factors-- such as light, temperature, salinity, and acidity-- cycle, shift, and fluctuate. Understanding how populations evolve under changing environments not only enriches our perspective on adaptation, but also improves our ability to predict how species may respond to rapid global climate change. We have explored adaptation to changing environments using microbes in the laboratory, in which we’ve shown that lower rates of environmental change can facilitate a broader range of evolutionary trajectories (Lindsey et al. 2013). We have also explored the impact of environmental factors on daphnid evolution in natural lake environments, in which we’ve shown that ultraviolet radiation can contribute to phenotypic divergence (Miner & Kerr, 2010; Miner et al., 2015). We remain interested in exploring the evolutionary effects of both temporal and spatial forms of environmental change.
