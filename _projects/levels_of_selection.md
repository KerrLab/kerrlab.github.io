blurb: Natural selection in populations where individuals are distributed into groups can generally be described from different perspectives (just like the famous cartoon from W. E. Hill simultaneously depicts both an older and younger woman). Working in collaboration with the philosopher of biology, Peter Godfrey-Smith, we have shown that the standard multi-level perspective and individualist perspective are mathematically interchangeable (Kerr & Godfrey-Smith 2002). Further, we suggest that there are heuristic advantages to keeping both perspectives in mind when approaching selection in group-structured populations. Thus, we have advocated a kind of “gestalt-switching” pluralism. This work has led to a reconsideration of the definition(s) of “altruism” (Kerr et al. 2004) as well as some statistical descriptions of evolutionary change that naturally translate to selection in group-structured populations (Kerr & Godfrey-Smith 2009, Fox & Kerr 2012). We have presented rigorous tests to determine when one perspective better captures the causal story of selection in particular case studies (Godfrey-Smith & Kerr 2013). This work places us in an interesting, but murky, philosophical realm, in which the nature of causality itself becomes an issue.
