blurb: Throughout nature, there are examples of organisms cooperating with others, both members of their own species and other species. But from an evolutionary perspective, cooperative behaviors seem counterintuitive. How do cooperators avoid being exploited by “cheaters” that do not pay the costs of cooperation, but benefit from the cooperation of others? One solution to this dilemma is found by cooperating only with other cooperators. Using both lab experiments and computer simulations, we have found that when organisms disperse and interact locally, patches of cooperators can outgrow cheater patches and become abundant (Prado & Kerr 2008; Nahum et al., 2011). When populations are mixed—similar to growth in a test tube—cooperators can be exploited by cheaters and driven to extinction. We have also explored how cooperator patches may be more likely to gain adaptations to their environment. These adaptations can be beneficial enough to give cooperators a selective advantage over non-adapted cheaters (Hammarlund et al., 2016; Connelly et al., 2016).
