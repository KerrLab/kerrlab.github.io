long_blurb: "I am assisting with the development and implementation of authentic research labs to be incorporated into the introductory biology series at the UW (HHMI 'STEM Dawgs' project). These course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) - are based on experimental evolution in the bacterium Escherichia coli.

I am also interested in the social lives of bacteria and their consequences for disease, the evolution of virulence, and antibiotic resistance."
